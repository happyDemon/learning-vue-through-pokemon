# Learning Vue.js through Pokemon

This repo contains the code for my tutorial series '[Vue.js explained through Pokemon](https://medium.com/@maximkerstens/vue-js-explained-through-pokemon-ac49516ba5d3#.tp1jszxgb)'.

This is a continuation on [Vue.js Pokemon Battle tutorial](https://medium.com/coding-artist/vue-js-pokemon-battle-tutorial-380cd72eb681#.thudhql24) where I dig a little deeper and explain several other features that Vue.js offers.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Published articles

This tutorial shows how to setup a work flow to use single file components,
splits the previous code base into 2 components and touches on computed properties.

## Roadmap
 - #2 Attack functionality: $refs, Promisses & simple event bus
 - #3 Switching it up with Vuex
 - #4 Transitions & animations
